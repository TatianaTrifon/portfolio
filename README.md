In this repo I'm going to create different kind of projects to improve and show my programming skills in Java.

**Projects:**

**1. mp3_player**

This project was realised by following this tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XJicRt_FaI&t=5834s to get better on programming in JavaFX.
The application is able to play the music, pause, reset, change to previous and next one, adjust the speed and the volume. 
More music can be added by downoading it and adding to the "music" package inside the "src"
In addition to that, I added some more features to make the app look more presentable. 

**2. task_manager**

In this project I created a task manager desktop application using JavaFX and JDBC.
The database is added in the project folder.
Application's functionality:
- User will be able to sign in/ sign up
- Create tasks
- Edit tasks
- Delete tasks
- Sort tasks according the priority
- Sort tasks according the category
- Change the user's password
- Delete account

3. fbs-backend

This project implements functionality of a flight booking service using SpringBoot and JDBC.
In this project, I implemented these functionality:
- Creating/editing/deleting airports
- Creating/editing/deleting airlines
- Creating/editing/deleting users
- Creating/editing/deleting flights by assigning them to the users and airlines

The functionality was checked using Postman and by doing tests using JUnit and Mockito
