In this repo I'm going to create different kind of projects to improve and show my programming skills in Java.

Projects:

1. mp3_player

This project was realised by following this tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XJicRt_FaI&t=5834s to get better on programming in JavaFX.
The application is able to play the music, pause, reset, change to previous and next one, adjust the speed and the volume. 
More music can be added by downoading it and adding to the "music" package inside the "src"
In addition to that, I added some more features to make the app look more presentable.
